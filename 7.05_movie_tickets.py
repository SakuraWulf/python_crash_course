"""
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person's 
age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they 
are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, 
the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and 
then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.
