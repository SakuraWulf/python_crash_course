Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7.08, make sure the 
sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli
has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all 
occurences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami  
sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.
