# Python has a removesuffix() suffix method that works exactly like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the extension,
# like some file browsers do.

filename = "python_notes.txt"
print(filename.removesuffix(".txt"))
